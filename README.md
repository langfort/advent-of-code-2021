# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

These are my [advent of code](adventofcode.com) 2021 solutions written in
GDScript.


## Project Structure
All of the solutions are comprised inside of a single Godot Engine project.
Part 1 and part 2 of each day can be found under the the folder for the
specified day. i.e. Day 1 part 1 is located at
`day_1_sonar_sweep/day_1_part_1.gd`.

Running the project will run all of the solutions.
