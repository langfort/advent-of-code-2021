# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

These are my [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) 2021 solutions written in
GDScript.


## Project Structure
All of the solutions are comprised inside of a single Godot Engine project.
Part 1, part 2, and the input file for each day can be found under the folder
for the specified day. i.e. Day 1 part 1 is located at `day_1/part_1.gd`.

Running the project will run all of the solutions.
